# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

- Please run the seed file to have a admin user.

- In heroku server I have created a admin user: email: admin@admin.com , password: password

- When logging in as an admin, you will be redirected to admin page, where you can see all the posts.
